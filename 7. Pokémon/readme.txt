This project is the submission for Pokémon, project 7 of HarvardX: CS50's Introduction to Game Development.
The original files were provided by the edX platform (see game files for more information).
Initially the project consisted of a technical demostration of a monster-based RPG like Pokémon, in which players can encounter wild monsters, fight them and level up when gaining enough experience points.

Functionalities added as per requirements of the course:
- After leveling up a menu appears showing, for each stat: the starting value, the amount increased and the new value.

Additional functionalities added and other changes (reason between parenthesis):
- The 5 original monsters have been replaced for a monster-generation system:
  - The name is generated with a simple function that randomly determines the number of syllabes and their letters.
  - The stats are random (within some limits).
  - The sprite is procedurally generated by using basic shapes and colors. This comes from another parallel project, so the implementation is not optimal and improvements could be made.
  - Very simple combat animations are created combining limb rotation with the original changes in color and opacity during attacks (also, the mouth opens).
- When an allied pokemon enters the combat, appears in the air, grows in size and then falls to the ground (to create a more dramatic entrance).
- In the field, the player can open a menu that can heal the party and allows to access a newly created party screen.
  - This party screen lets players see all the monsters in the party with their stats and sprite.
  - The first monster in the party with HP remaining will be the active monster during combat. Players can swap the monsters to change the order. 
  - If the player's active monster is defeated during combat, the party screen appears and makes the player choose another monster to enter the fight.
  - Instead of starting with 1 monster, players start with 3 to test these functionalities.
- Now the remaining xp gains after leveling up are shown (and can trigger new level ups if they reach the new level-up threshold).
- Numerous sounds added (messages, menu navigation, monster appearing...)
- Minor bugfixes (the game would crash if pressing enter just after seeing the 'Level up' or the 'Successfully fleed' messages).

All the new sounds added have been created with Bfxr (https://www.bfxr.net/).
The game icon has been created with GIMP (https://www.gimp.org/).
